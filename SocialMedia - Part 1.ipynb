    "# 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of social-media discussions has grown to be an important tool for biomedical informatics researchers, particularly for addressing questions relevant to public perceptions of health and related matters. Studies have examination of a range of topics at the intersection of health and social media, including studies of how [Facebook might be used to commuication health information](http://www.jmir.org/2016/8/e218/), how Tweets might be used to understand how smokers perceive [e-cigarettes, hookahs and other emerging smoking products](https://www.jmir.org/2013/8/e174/), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each investigation has unique aspects, studies of social media generally share several common tasks. Data acquisition is often the first challenge: although some data may be freely available, there are often [limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits) as to how much data can be queried easily. Researchers might look out for [opportunities for accessing larger amounts of data](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/twitter-promises-share-secrets-academia/). Some studies contract with [commercial services providing fee-based access](https://gnip.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a data set is hand, the next step is often to identify key terms and phrases relating to the research question. Messages might be annotated to indicate specific categorizations of interest - indicating, for example, if a message referred to a certain aspect of a disease or symptom. Similarly, key words and phrases regularly occurring in the content might also be identified. Natural language and text processing techniques might be used to extract key words, phrases, and relationships, and machine learning tools might be used to build classifiers capable of distinguishing between types of tweets of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module presents a preliminary overview of these techniques, using Python 3 and several auxiliary libraries to explore the application of these techniques to Twitter data. \n",

Although details of the tools used to access data and the format and content of the data may differ for various services, the strategies and procedures used to analyze the data will generalize to other tools."

    "[Twitter](www.twitter.com) provides limited capabilities for searching tweets through an Application Programming Interface (API) based on Representational State Transfer (REST).  [REST](https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337228) is an approach to using web-based Hypertext-Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests as APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a REST API specifies conventions for HTTP requests that might be used to retrieve specific data items from a remote server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which return HTML markup to be rendered in web browsers, REST APIs return data formatted in XML or JSON, suitable for interpretation by computer programs. REST APIs from familiar websites underlie frequently-seen functionality such as embedded twitter widgets and \"like/share\" links, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial REST applications often use \"API-Keys\" - unique identifiers used to associate requests with registered accounts. Here, we will walk through the process of registering for Twitter API keys and using a Python library to manage the details of making a Twitter API request and receiving a response.\n",

    "The first step in registering for a Twitter API key is to [signup](https://twitter.com/signup) for an account. If you don't want to post anything or to use the account in any way that might be linked to your regular email adddress, you might want to create a special-purpose account using a service such as gmail, and use this new email address for the twitter account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to  [Twitter's developer site](https://dev.twitter.com) an click on the \"apply\" link to create a developer account (look on the upper-right cornder, near the magnifying glass search icon). Follow the listed steps, indicating that you are interested in access for your own personal use. You will need to answer a few questions about the assignment and your goals. Answer these questions as appropriate - simply indicate that you are working on a class assignment and that you won't be showing anything commecially. Submit your application and wait for it to be approved. This might take a bit of time - please start early.\n",

    "One you are approved, log in and go to the [developer site](https://dev.twitter.com). Select \"Apps\" to create new apps. Click on \"Create New App\" in the upper right and then fill out the form. The main thing that you need to focus on here is the application name, description, and website. The rest can be ignored.\n",

    "Given the complexity of the data being discussed, we should create a class to store our tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This class will be based on a dictionary called `tweets`. This dictionary will be indexed by the ID string of the tweet. Each element of the dictionary will itself be a dictionary, with the following contents:\n",
    "* `tweet` will refer to the full tweet\n",
    "* `count` contains the number of times it occurs in the dataset. Generally, this will be zero, but we might have a need for allowing for a tweet to occur multiple times.\n",
    "* `searchTime` will contain the timestamp of when a tweet was searched or added to the set.\n",
    "* `seachTerm` will contain the term used to search for the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have methods for adding tweets, retrieving tweets by id, tracking the number of times we see each tweet, and other useful features. We'll also add a routine to find the most frequently-seen tweets by ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a `searchTweets` routine to search for a set of unique tweets of a given size matching a given query. This will be called by the default constructor if search terms and counts are provided.  `searchTweets` will query for the number of desired tweets, up to the size required, knowing that Twitter will only return a maximum of 100 /query.  Any returned tweets will be checked for duplications and unique tweets will be added to the set. This will be repeated until the desired corpus size is retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that searching for a large set of tweets might take some time. I have noticed that the same search run twice in succession might yield almost identical results, which is not what we want if we are looking for a large, diverse set. The two-minute delay in `searchTwitter` might help, but it might not. To get around this, we can conduct multiple searches and combine results using `combineTweets`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`getText` will retrieve the text that we're interested in for a given tweet. If the tweet is not a retwet, the `full_text` field will be returned. However, if it is a retweet, the `full_text` of the original tweet will be returne. Thus, we will ahve the maximal amount of text available to analyze.  \n",
